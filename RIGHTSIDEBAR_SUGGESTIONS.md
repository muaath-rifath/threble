## API Endpoints Created

### `/api/user/suggestions/communities`
**Method**: GET  
**Query Parameters**:
- `limit` (optional, default: 5) - Number of suggestions to return

**Response**:
```json
{
  "communities": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "name": "string", 
      "description": "string",
      "image": "string",
      "creator": {...},
      "_count": {
        "members": number,
        "posts": number
      },
      "suggestion": {
        "reason": "connections" | "following",
        "users": [...], // Up to 3 users
        "totalCount": number
      }
    }
  ],
  "hasMoreSuggestions": boolean,
  "message": "string" // Encouragement message if no connections
}
```

### `/api/user/suggestions/people`
**Method**: GET  
**Query Parameters**:
- `limit` (optional, default: 5) - Number of suggestions to return

**Response**:
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "username": "string", 
      "image": "string",
      "profile": {
        "bio": "string",
        "location": "string"
      },
      "suggestion": {
        "reason": "mutual_connections",
        "mutualConnections": [...], // Up to 3 mutual connections
        "mutualConnectionCount": number,
        "reasonText": "string" // Human readable reason
      }
    }
  ],
  "hasMoreSuggestions": boolean,
  "message": "string" // Encouragement message if no connections
}
```

## Database Optimization
The suggestion algorithms are optimized to:
- Use proper database indexes on relationships
- Limit query results to prevent performance issues
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use efficient JOIN operations for related data

## User Experience Enhancements
1. **Progressive Loading**: Shows skeleton loaders during fetch
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
3. **Empty States**: Encouraging messages when no suggestions available
4. **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and smooth animations
5. **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML and keyboard navigation

## Implementation Details

### Suggestion Algorithm for Communities:
1. Get user's current community memberships (to exclude)
2. Get user's connections (accepted status) and follows
3. Find communities where these people are members
4. Rank by number of relevant people in each community
5. Return top suggestions with context

### Suggestion Algorithm for People:
1. Get user's existing connections (to exclude)
2. Find connections of user's connections (2nd degree)
3. Exclude users already connected or with pending requests
4. Count mutual connections for each suggestion
5. Return top suggestions ranked by mutual connection count

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Community suggestions based on interests/tags
- [ ] People suggestions based on shared communities
- [ ] Machine learning for better suggestion ranking
- [ ] Real-time updates when connections change
- [ ] Suggestion reason diversity (not just mutual connections)
- [ ] Integration with user preferences and activity
